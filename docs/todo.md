## Getting started
- [x] D3 refreshing
- [x] Initial prototype

## Data Structure
- [x] Hypergraph data structure
  - [x] Graph properties (id, label)
  - [x] Node (id)
  - [x] Edge (id, nodeSet) - external only
  - [x] Arbitrary properties (support label, subset membership) - Inherent, thank you JavaScript.
  - [x] Indices for quick resort and computation (edge -> nodes, nodes -> edges)

## Visualization
- [x] Rewrite prototype
- [ ] Labels/tooltips
- [ ] Re-sorting nodes
- [ ] Re-sorting edges
- [ ] Color by sort
- [ ] Node/edge selection
- [ ] Subset tools
- [ ] Editing tools
- [ ] Metrics subview


## Pressing issues
- [ ] Split into modules. Single .html? Yuck..
